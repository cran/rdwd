- dataDWD: potentially use curl to download data without sleep need
- expand + automate localtests, e.g. with all non-cran-run examples
- selectDWD: if res/var/per is NA or "", give a selection popup
- for per="monthly", make readDWD recognize MESS_DATUM_ENDE and _BEGINN, potentially create new column MESS_DATUM yyyy-mm-15
- readDWD: figure out reason for fread trouble (reported in emails by some users)
- readVars: test for all FTP folders (one file each), automate column name addition
- allow abbreviations of res hourly/daily/monthly

Version 0.6.1 (2017-01-24)
Initial release of the package, development can be seen at
https://github.com/brry/rdwd/compare/master@{2016-10-19}...master@{2017-01-24}

'selectDWD' uses index information to find files matching a path or station criteria.
With the returned path/file names, 'dataDWD' and 'readDWD' download and read data.
'dirDWD' and 'fileDWD' control that no file will be overwritten and path messages are useful.
'indexDWD' lists all the files on the FTP server with DWD data.
'createIndex' uses that list to create 'fileIndex', 'metaIndex' and 'geoIndex'.
'mapDWD' is an interactive leaflet map also useful to explore datasets.

Note: 'dataDWD' and 'readDWD' were started in June 2016 within my misc package
berryFunctions, from which they will be deleted after rdwd is on CRAN
