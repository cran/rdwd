\title{Create a recursive index of the DWD CDC FTP Server}
\usage{
indexDWD(folder = unique(dirname(fileIndex$path)),
  base = "ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_germany/climate",
  sleep = 0, dir = "DWDdata", quiet = FALSE, progbar = !quiet,
  verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{folder}{Folder to be indexed recursively, e.g. "/hourly/wind/".
DEFAULT: all folders at \code{base} in current \code{\link{fileIndex}}}

\item{base}{Main directory of DWD ftp server, defaulting to observed climatic records.
DEFAULT: \url{ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_germany/climate}}

\item{sleep}{If not 0, a random number of seconds between 0 and \code{sleep}
is passed to \code{\link{Sys.sleep}} after each read folder
to avoid getting kicked off the FTP-Server. DEFAULT: 0}

\item{dir}{Writeable directory name where to save the downloaded file.
Created if not existent. DEFAULT: "DWDdata" at current \code{\link{getwd}()}}

\item{quiet}{Suppress message about directory and failed
\code{RCurl::\link[RCurl]{getURL}}? DEFAULT: FALSE}

\item{progbar}{Logical: present a progress bar in each level?
Only works if the R package pbapply is available. DEFAULT: TRUE}

\item{verbose}{Logical: write a lot of messages from \code{RCurl::\link[RCurl]{getURL}}?
DEFAULT: FALSE (usually, you dont need all the curl information)}
}
\value{
currently a vector with file paths (output may change in the future)

\description{
Create a list of all the files (in subfolders) at the Climate Data Center (CDC)
FTP-Server from the German Weather Service (DWD, Deutscher WetterDienst) at
\url{ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_germany/climate}.\cr
The R package \code{RCurl} must be available to do this.
If \code{RCurl::\link[RCurl]{getURL}} fails, usually because bot access is
detected and denied, there will stil be an output which you can pass in a
second run via \code{folder} to extract the remaining dirs.
You might want to wait a bit and set \code{sleep} to a higher value in that case.
}
\details{
It's not suggested to run this for all folders, as it can take quite some time
and you may get kicked off the FTP-Server. This package contains an index
of the climatic observations at weather stations: \code{View(rdwd:::\link{fileIndex})}
If it is out of date, please let me know!
