<p>The <code>rdwd</code> package provides a collection of all the metafiles on the <a href="ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_germany/climate">DWD data server</a>. It is presented as an interactive map below.</p>
<p>When a point is clicked, an infobox should appear. The first line can be copypasted into R to obtain more information on the available files. The map is created with the following code:</p>

<p>The blue dots mark stations for which recent files are available (with &gt;=1 file in ‘recent’ folder or ‘BIS_DATUM’ later than one year ago). The red dots mark all stations with only historical datasets.</p>
<p>To see only the stations with recent data, use the following code:</p>
