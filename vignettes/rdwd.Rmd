`rdwd` is an R interface to data from the German weather service (DWD)

It provides three categories of services:

* find, select, download + read data
* vectorized, progress bars, no re-downloads
* index of files + meta data

for three types of data:

* observational time series from 6k meteorological recording stations  (2.5k active)
  -> rain, temperature, wind, sunshine, pressure, cloudiness, humidity, snow, ...
* gridded raster data from radar + interpolation
* european data stock slowly growing (but reading functions not tested yet)
