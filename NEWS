rdwd Version history

-----------------------------

Version 1.0.0 (2019-03-17)
First major version increase!
Tests are now systematic and comprehensive (albeit run locally and manually to reduce CRAN load and enable local file writing).
selectDWD got a very noticable performance boost and an interactive res/var/per selection.
Handling raster files is now supported in rdwd.
Examples and vignettes have been refined.
Detailed changes can be found on https://github.com/brry/rdwd/commits, here's the main overview:

- dataDWD: dots now passed to readDWD, download errors checked and returned as informative warning
- readDWD: reading functions added for binary, raster and multi_annual files, MESS_DATUM POSIXct column added in monthly data, list output now named
- indexFTP: now removes duplicates from file list, sped up in default 1min/prec usage
- rdwd now works fine with multi_annual and subdaily data
- readVars: parameter abbreviations completed, output now visible
- selectDWD: order of arguments changed, interactive res/var/per selection enabled, computing speed extremely increased
- localtests.R heavily expanded, examples reduced and refined

Version 0.6.1 (2017-01-24)
Initial release of the package, development can be seen at
https://github.com/brry/rdwd/compare/master@{2016-10-19}...master@{2017-01-24}

'selectDWD' uses index information to find files matching a path or station criteria.
With the returned path/file names, 'dataDWD' and 'readDWD' download and read data.
'dirDWD' and 'fileDWD' control that no file will be overwritten and path messages are useful.
'indexDWD' lists all the files on the FTP server with DWD data.
'createIndex' uses that list to create 'fileIndex', 'metaIndex' and 'geoIndex'.
'mapDWD' is an interactive leaflet map also useful to explore datasets.

Note: 'dataDWD' and 'readDWD' were started in June 2016 within my misc package
berryFunctions, from which they will be deleted after rdwd is on CRAN
